# psamid3: ID3 classification on the PSAM spam database
Bart Massey

This repository contains a couple of things:

* Instances (feature-vectors) from the
  [PSAM](http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~bart/papers/spam.pdf) spam
  corpus of some years ago. Each `csv` file contains
  instances consisting of a name, a class (1 for spam, 0 for
  ham), and a vector of features obtained via
  big-bag-of-words and
  [SpamAssassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/) analyses.

* Python code for an ID3 decision tree classifier for the
  instances. The classifier uses entropy gain limits to
  avoid overfitting and performs *n-*way cross-validation.

## Running

To run on the "personal" corpus with 10-way
cross-validation, say

    python3 id3.py personal.csv 10

The output will consist of the accuracy for each
cross-validation split.
